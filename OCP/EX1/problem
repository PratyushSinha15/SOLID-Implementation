Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

1. Definition

OCP (Open/Closed Principle):
“Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.”

Matlab:
        New features → extend (add new classes/code).
        Existing working code → don’t modify

2. Problem Statement

We need a Notification System that can send messages on multiple platforms:
    1.Email
    2.SMS
    3.WhatsApp
Future me aur platforms add ho sakte hain (Slack, Push notification, etc).
